      'login'=>'webservice',
      'password'=> '12345',
      'entity'=>'1');
    $category_id = '1'; // Category ID (get the created product category id from llx_categorie)
    $generic_id = '2'; // Web service user id (get the Ref. from User card)

Functionality
- Once products are created in Dolibarr using the 'WEB' category you can activate Doliwoo plugin in Wordpress. At the moment of activation the products are imported to Woocommerce. After that, a cron job will import the new products (daily).
- Also VAT tax definitions will be imported to Woocommerce.
- Create an Order in Woocommerce. The order will be exported to Dolibarr.
- Users from Woocommerce will be exported to Dolibarr at the time of order exporting. For testing, you should first create the user account, log in and afterwards create the order and proceed with the checkout.
